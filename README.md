Global Debt Trends Dashboard (1950–2022)
This project analyzes global debt trends using data from the International Monetary Fund’s Global Debt Database. The dashboard explores how different types of debt—government, household, corporate, and private—have evolved over time and how they are distributed across countries.
The goal of this project is to demonstrate data cleaning, transformation, and visualization skills using Power BI, while showing very clear, policy-relevant insights.
